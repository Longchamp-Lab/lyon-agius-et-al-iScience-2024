# Abstract
One-week protein restriction (PR) limits ischemia-reperfusion (IR) damages and improves metabolic fitness. Similarly, longer-term calory restriction results in increased lifespan, partly via reduced Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF)-1. However, the influence of short-term PR on IGF-1 and its impact on IR are unknown. PR was achieved in mice via one-week carbohydrate loading and/or through a low-protein diet. PR decreased IGF-1 circulating levels as well as renal and hepatic expression. Upon renal IR, serum IGF-1 positively correlated with renal dysfunction and tissular damages, independently of sex and age.  Exogenous IGF-1 administration abrogated PR benefits during IR, while IGF-1 receptor inhibition with linsitinib was protective. IGF-1 was associated with a reduction in forkhead box O (FoxO), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways previously demonstrated to improve IR resilience in various organs. These data support dietary or pharmacological reduction of IGF1 signaling to mitigate IR injury prior to solid organ transplantation and beyond.
